# VRMicroProjects
A collection of small VR projects I've worked on that are not full projects but more to practice and learn more in VR development


Interaction Micro Project
  This scene is used to create and test various interactions with objects and their interactions with other objects. 
  It includes a barbecue that can cook food items, a dart board with darts, a basketball and net & water to soak items.
